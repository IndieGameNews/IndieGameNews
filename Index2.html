                attribution: "IndieGameNews 01/06/25",
                content: [


"Let's jump right in—\"Thrack the Fox\" has caught a little bit of attention already. Could you tell us about the inspiration behind the game?",
"",
"Godway Games: Well, we had a lot of different inspirations, massively taking following in the footsteps of PlayStation and N64 titles, while trying to maintain conveniences you'd find in more modern games and ensuring as many people could play it as possible, hence why the specs are so purposefully low.",
"",
"That sounds like a thoughtful and ambitious blend of old and new! Nostalgia meets modern accessibility—love it. What specific elements from those classic PlayStation and N64 titles can players expect to see in Thrack the Fox? Are there any features or gameplay mechanics you’re especially excited about?",
"",
"Godway Games: A favorite feature of mine, granted that we can actually accomplish it, was one of my own ideas. It will allow modders to use the console to develop their mods directly in the game’s ecosystem during runtime and even test them on the fly. It’s called the Thrack Modding API, and as far as I can tell, it’s a one-of-a-kind thing all its own.",
"",
"The Thrack Modding API sounds like a game-changer—literally! That level of integration and accessibility for modders is incredibly forward-thinking. Allowing them to work within the game’s ecosystem during runtime must open up endless possibilities for creativity and customization. How do you envision this feature shaping the Thrack the Fox community? Do you think it could extend the game's lifespan by empowering players to create their own content?",
"",
"Godway Games: Oh absolutely, it’s a mod-creator’s dream tool.",
"",
"I can see that! It’s not just a tool; it’s an invitation to the community to co-create and evolve the game alongside you. That’s bound to build a passionate following. Speaking of community, do you have any plans to showcase or support mods created by players? For example, could we see a curated mod spotlight or even an official mod marketplace down the line?",
"",
"Godway Games: It’s already in development actually; we’ve begun work on a back-end for the game. But of course, we are a small team and may have to scrap the entire concept altogether due to budget and staffing limitations.",
"",
"It’s incredible that you’re thinking so far ahead, even while balancing the challenges of being a small team. The back-end for a modding ecosystem is no small task, but it sounds like a fantastic way to amplify player creativity and engagement if you can pull it off. What would you say has been the biggest challenge in developing Thrack the Fox so far? And on the flip side, what has been the most rewarding moment for your team?",
"",
"Godway Games: Thrack has been developed under a consistent shoestring budget and on a constant skeleton crew. There’s never a day that more than five people are active out of a team of about 22, as we simply wouldn’t be able to afford it. As for the most rewarding moment? Probably Mr. P giving us the greenlight to begin with.",
"",
"That’s a testament to your team’s passion and resilience. Building a game under those constraints is no easy feat, but it’s clear how dedicated you all are to making Thrack the Fox a reality. Hats off to you for persevering through those challenges! And Mr. P giving you the greenlight—that sounds like a pivotal moment. Can you tell us a bit more about that? What made his support so meaningful for the project?",
"",
"Godway Games: Without Mr. P, there would be no studio at all; we were either going to work on Codename: Bridge or we were going to work on a different game codenamed Untitled Puzzle Game. I did some work on the second, but of course, 90% of my time has gone into the first, which became Thrack the Fox.",
"",
"It’s fascinating to hear how those early decisions shaped the studio and the direction of Thrack the Fox! It sounds like Mr. P’s belief in the project was the foundation that allowed everything to take off. Switching gears a bit—what is it about Thrack the Fox that sets it apart from other indie games in the same genre? What do you hope players will take away from their experience with the game?",
"",
"Godway Games: Innovative gameplay technology, its take on using older graphics for both efficiency and its style, and of course the quirky characters found within the game itself. In Thrack’s world, everyone is a little bit off. This is purposeful—the characters are fun to talk to and interact with, and most of them would seem completely insane by real-world standards, but in Thrack’s world, they’re considered normal.",
"",
"That’s such a unique approach! It’s not every day that you hear about a game embracing a world where quirky, eccentric characters are the standard. It sounds like it’s going to make Thrack the Fox a memorable experience not just for its gameplay, but for its personality and humor. Do you have a personal favorite character from the game? Or maybe one whose creation brought some particularly fun or interesting challenges?",
"",
"Godway Games: Probably Taegromo, but I can’t say why without spilling details. All I can say is that he’s a blue dragon who will be in the game’s story.",
"",
"A blue dragon named Taegromo—now that’s intriguing! I can already sense there’s something special about that character, especially with how tight-lipped you’re being. I’ll take your word for it that we’re in for a treat when it comes to his role in the story. Before we wrap up, is there anything you’d like to share with your fans and potential players about the future of Thrack the Fox? What can they look forward to, and how can they support the game during its development?",
"",
"Godway Games: We have been considering an Indiegogo or Kickstarter or something of the sort. If people could donate to it, that’d massively speed up our development cycle.",
"",
"That’s a great idea! Crowdfunding could be a game-changer in terms of accelerating development and helping Thrack the Fox reach its full potential. It’s always exciting to see fans directly supporting the game they’re passionate about. I’m sure your community will be eager to jump on board and help in any way they can. We’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for updates, and I’m sure the game’s supporters will rally behind it. Thank you so much for sharing insights into the development of Thrack the Fox—it’s clear this is a project fueled by heart, creativity, and determination. Best of luck to you and the team as you continue bringing this world to life!",

                content: [


"Recently I had an interview with a developer on the state of affairs in the industry, ",
"these were the results of our interaction.",
"",
"1.) What do you think the biggest problems are in the current industry?",
"",
"Lack of focus on gameplay.",
"",
"2.) would you like to expand on that?",
"",
"I've just noticed an uncomfortable trend of games focusing on adding more gimmicks, and making things more complicated, ",
"rather than iterating on the base features of the game to make them as fun as possible.",
"Look at the Call of Duty franchise, it's been around for more than 2 decades, ",
"it's a game about shooting people with guns. ",
"What significant improvement has been made on gun mechanics in the franchise?",
"At a basic level, the mechanics of how the guns handle, and operate is unchanged back to the first game in the franchise. ",
"Some mix of RNG and sight bloom, as if a better alternative doesn't exist.",
"Luckily, the competition from Helldivers 2 seems to have inspired Treyarch to improve movement for the first time since maybe the original MW2? ",
"Omnimovement definitely is a gimmick, and doesn't have a huge effect on gameplay experience, ",
"but at least it shows they are willing to shake things up, when suitable competition comes a-knocking.",
"",
"3.) What would you as a developer like to see changed?",
"",
"I'd probably change a few things.",
"I think that generally, time-to-kill in games should be decreased,",
"I don't think that the increase in TTK that has been observed over the past few years is executed very well. ",
"I think the game design they are going for, increase movement speed, and increase TTK will help them with casual audiences, ",
"which may be true, however I think it removes the penalty players incur when they put themselves in a bad position.",
"Other than that, I'd like to see general gun mechanics improve,",
"I don't think a game dedicated to shooting guns should have the most basic accuracy/recoil system consisting of camera recoil and sight bloom.",
"I think games like Insurgency Sandstorm and Ready or Not have good ideas, ",
"having bullets fire from the barrel, and applying recoil as simulations/dynamic animations to the model.",
"",
"4.) what other titles do you believe suffer from these aforementioned problems?",
"",
"It's hard to say. ",
"Battlefield definitely has to a degree. A game that I used to play a lot,",
"which I think was quite innovative in it's lifespan is Phantom Forces, a Roblox game. ",
"Over the years of balance updates, movement speed has increased significantly,",
"where most weapons across the board have been nerfed.",
"",
"I know there are some players that do enjoy the fast movement and slower TTK, ",
"but more than anything I wish that the modern idea of forever-games didn't exist. ",
"We still have the option to go back and play the original MW2, in almost exactly the same way as it released. ",
"There's a certain point with live-service games where developers need to consider the game \"done\" and release a sequel, ",
"leaving the original game intact.",
"",
"5.) It's a pity that this is the case. Would you like to elaborate on your experiences explaining how we got to this point?",
"",
"It's definitely been the increase in competitive play. ",
"It seems like everyone would rather focus on winning than having a good time. ",
"I see it fairly frequently, where people don't play games because the game itself is fun, ",
"but because they are addicted to winning, increasing their kill/death ratio, unlocking the next character/weapon, ",
"or whatever other pseudo-addictive game design feature.",
"It's a stark contrast compared to the era of Xbox 360 games, that were all very casual/party focused. ",
"Halo 5 exemplifies this shift, compared to Halo 3 or Reach, which still had a very large casual audience.",
"",
"6.) And when do you think this shift began, with Halo 5 as you mentioned? Why the change?",
"",
"Probably the success of E-sports games like Counter Strike and Rainbow Six Siege. ",
"Developers want to cash in on the competitions. ",
"There have been a lot of games trying to force themselves into being perfectly balanced and competitive experiences, ",
"Insurgency Sandstorm's release was a bit of a flop due to how heavily they tried to lean into marketing it as a competitive PVP game, ",
"rather than what the game actually excels at.",
"",
"7.) is there anything else in the development landscape you'd like to touch on? the Palworld-Nintendo Situation? EA Games? Helldivers? ConcernedApe? Or something else?",
"",
"That all sounds like industry drama to be honest. ",
"I don't thinks it's really profitable or productive for anyone, except maybe tabloid journalists who need clickbait. ",
"there has been, and always will be some form of drama going on, ",
"I think the only thing that might have a positive effect on the industry would be better games.",
"",
"8.) What do you think the future of gaming looks like in terms of innovation? ",
"Are there any trends you’re particularly excited, or worried about?",
"",
"I'm definitely interested to see how communities like the Redot Engine progress, ",
"I hope that idea of \"Just make games\" helps the industry focus on quality, ",
"rather than quantity or graphics/art.",
"",
"9.) how would you describe the \"just make games\" philosophy to those reading this?",
"",
"Gaming isn't about the developers belief. ",
"Games shouldn't be about making sure everyone has the same opinions, ",
"and most people don't want to play games that try to force the player to submit to the developer's opinions. ",
"Just focus on the game itself, and how you can make it as good as it can be. Respect other people's beliefs and opinions, ",
"and don't sacrifice your reputation or waste your time in a vain attempt to force people to agree with your own opinions.",
"",
"10.) some would argue that it's impossible to create a story without putting your own bias in it, how do you rebuttal that?",
"",
"There are plenty of examples of stories, ",
"especially those with sensitive subject matter that do not force the player/reader/viewer to believe in something they do not, ",
"nor shame them for the beliefs they might have. ",
"When I watched \"The Zone of Interest\", ",
"I didn't necessarily agree with everything that is portrayed in the film, ",
"and I assume even the writers and actors would disagree with the actions and historical figures being portrayed, ",
"but despite it all, noone was lectured about their beliefs. ",
"They never told the characters or the viewers how they needed to interpret the events depicted. ",
"The movie itself was just a raw and direct account of events, ",
"with the audience left to digest and take away whatever meaning they might find. ",
"I don't personally believe that media that preaches and pushes certain opinions are persuasive to most audiences. ",
"At the end of the day, that's why it's unproductive to try to force your will onto others.",
"",
"11.) What do you think gamers could do right now to mitigate some of the issues you addressed?",
"",
"Know what you are getting into. ",
"Don't support developers or franchises that treat your poorly, or look down on you. ",
"The consumer is the most valuable part of any business, and without them no business can succeed.",
"",
"12.) is there anything people could do to help support you and your development career?",
"",
"By far the most valuable thing to have is a community. ",
"If you are interested in game development, flight simulators, or sandbox games, ",

                attribution: "IndieGameNews 01/06/25",
                content: [



"LuckyBrawl. It's a 2D shooter game where you can gain points to unlock unique and diverse characters, ",
"new environments, new gamemodes, and environment-exclusive gamemodes,",
"and has map settings. It's available on PC, web, and mobile.",
"Below is an interview between me and 77Lucky7 himself.",
"",
"1.) Can you explain the mechanics behind the X-Points system for unlocking characters and environments? What was your thought process in designing this progression system?",
"",
"X-Points can be gained by winning battles. Once you reach certain thresholds, you will unlock characters and environments. ",
"The number of X-Points required are specified on the locked character's icon or environment button. ",
"I wanted to make this progression system a way for players to diversify their experience while playing the game, ",
"while also being curious about what they may unlock next in the game.",
"",
"2.) What are your plans for future updates or expansions for \"LuckyBrawl\"?",
"",
"For future updates, I plan to add more characters and game modes. ",
"I may also add limited-time characters and/or game modes by having an update available for a week (for example) before locking the character.",
"I also plan to add more lore behind all of the characters, since I like the idea of having players connect with the characters, like them, and/or potentially relate to them.",
"I could add other ideas based on feedback, and I want to make sure that the features I add have some kind of purpose and make the game more interesting.",
"",
"3.) Are there any new features or game modes you're excited to introduce in future updates?",
"",
"Yes, there are new features and game modes that I'm excited to introduce in future updates.",
"",
"4.) What sets LuckyBrawl apart from other games 2d web shooter games?",
"",
"LuckyBrawl is special because there are unique characters and environments that are both familiar and unfamiliar. ",
"The location for an environment may be familiar,",
"but the dynamics of the characters to belong to it along with the exclusive game modes that belong to those environments add the style that makes it all unique.",
"LuckyBrawl is also special because of its map settings, which gives the players the choice of how they can play the game. Players can choose the number of teams,",
"teammates, length of a game round, and a range for minimum and maximum map sizes that the map's size for a round will be within.",
"",
"5.) You mentioned before this interview that your player base was struggling, why do you believe that is?",
"",
"I believe that my player base is struggling because I have only gotten a few comments on the game and only about 30 views total. ",
"It has only been 3 days since the game has released, and I'm not sure if the game will be able to grow without consistently posting about it on social media. ",
"I do understand that the game might need more time to get popular, and I hope that it does get more popular soon so that I can have more feedback and ideas to work with. ",
"I like seeing others' ideas and being inspired by them.",
"",
"6.) It's quite difficult to get a game to function on so many different devices, how were you able to accomplish this?",
"",
"I was able to make LuckyBrawl able to function on different devices by using the tools Unity has. ",
"Unity has tools which make my game able to function on PC, web, and mobile. ",
"Besides that, I also used Unity's pivot and anchoring system to make my UI elements able to fit on a variety of different sizes. ",
"It took several tries to get the UI elements on each screen working without being cut off, stretched incorrectly, or off-screen.",
"",
"7.) I noticed LuckyBrawl was published back on August 27th of 2023, yet it was updated a mere 2 days ago.",
"why have you continued to maintain it if as you'd stated it had such a small player base?",
"",
"Actually, the game itself was published on January 1st, 2025.",
"August 27th, 2023 may be referring to the game mod it used to be, and I was inspired to turn it into a full game instead so that I can have more freedom with making the kind of game I want to make. ",
"As I developed it, it did have a small player base, ",
"and I believed that I could make it get more popular if I actually started to release a version for everyone to play and start promoting it on social media.",
"",
"8.) why don't X points dispaly during battle's?",
"",
"X-Points do not display during battles since there aren't any game modes which involve gaining X-Points in the middle of a battle, and I think it may block the player's field of view a little bit.",
"",
"9.) As far as I can see LuckyBrawl is the only game you've published if this is true do you have plans for any future titles?",
"",
"As of right now, I do not have any plans for future titles. I do hope I can make future ones though, or at the very least, continue updating LuckyBrawl and make it the best game it could be.",
"",
"10.) How has your experience as a game developer evolved while working on \"LuckyBrawl\"?",
"",
"While working on LuckyBrawl, I was quite clueless on where to start. However, using AI has helped me figure out how to make everything work. ",
"I already knew how to make graphical assets, music, and sound effects based on previous experience. ",
"On the first month of working on LuckyBrawl (September to October 2024), I was able to mostly develop the game successfully. ",
"However, what messed my progress up is that I had to revamp the entire team system since I had not originally designed the game with mechanics to handle multiple teams with multiple teammates and enemies. ",
"I kept running into a lot of bugs when adding these mechanics despite having different ideas of how to fix them, and I had decided to quit making the game for a month due to a lack of motivation and time. ",
"However, a month later (in November), I had found enough time and motivation to continue making the game, but that time, I had an idea that I believed could potentially work. ",
"I decided to make a new Unity game from scratch while keeping the original, broken version of the game. I used AI and my ideas to code everything from scratch, trying to be as specific as possible with what I wanted and what I needed in order to make it work. ",
"This clean, unbugged version of the game ended up being a prototype for the game mode players start off with. Then, I decided that it was time to start merging the two versions together. ",
"I removed the old system and ended up successfully replacing it with the new system. From there, it was a matter of doing research and learning from the AI about how I could add all of the features that the game currently has. ",
"I experienced many bugs along the way, but now, I feel comfortable and confident in my ability to make new in-game content and features.",
"",
"11.) LuckyBrawl is available for free on itch.io, What incentivizes your development?",
"",
"What incentivizes me to create LuckyBrawl was my inspiration from other games, ",
"the potential ideas that I could add to my game that the other games didn't already have, ",
"and the potential things I could do with the game if it had an active community. If the game had an active community, ",
"I could do things such as creating polls to vote on things for future in-game content and creating characters and game modes based on the community's ideas. ",
"I was also incentivized by the potential money I could make by making a likable and versatile game. ",
"There was supposed to be a shop where players could buy X-Points to unlock later in-game content so that I could get money and not have to get a regular job, ",
"though I didn't think the feature would have a purpose without enough players playing my game. ",
"I do plan to add the shop if the game gets popular enough.",
"",
"",
"12.)Have you considered implementing multiplayer features or community events in LuckyBrawl? If so, what would they look like?",
"",
"I have considered adding multiplayer features in LuckyBrawl, ",
"but I decided not to add them for now since game servers can cost money. ",
"I have also considered adding community events. If the game gets a bigger community, ",
"community events would likely revolve around some kind of challenge in order to unlock exclusive rewards, ",
"though I would need to think more about how exactly the system would work once the game does get a bigger community.",
"",
"13.) What inspired you to enter game development?",
"",
"What inspired me to enter game development is that there are always viral games that people on the internet and in real life are talking about. ",
"I see games as a way to provide a uniquely styled experience to players, ",
"and I believe that I could make a game without or with less flaws compared to other games. ",
"Going viral has a lot of potential, and by making a good, promising game, I believe it can definitely be possible.",
"",
"14.)What tools or game engines did you use to develop \"LuckyBrawl\", and why did you choose them?",
"",
"I used Scratch (www.scratch.mit.edu) to create the art and sounds.",
"I found it quite interesting how using a millisecond of random sounds and copying, pasting, speeding up, slowing down, and using other effects could somehow lead to the creation of new and interesting sounds. ",
"I chose to use Scratch for these things because I had used it for a couple of years in the past before,",
" and it served as a starting point for making games since it teaches the fundamentals for doing so.",
" It also inspired me to move onto more advanced engines. I chose Unity since it is a popular and versatile game engine,",
" and I've seen a game that uses Unity go viral before.",
"",
"15.) I noticed you have a discord, what does your playerbase/community mean to you?",
"",
"My community is a way for me to make my game better, while also allowing me to potentially connect with people with similar interests. ",
"I also view my community as a source of ideas and inspiration and a means of interaction that allows me to make my game interactive and interesting.",
"",
"16.) How can other people support your continued future development and career?",
"",
"People can support my future development and career by following/joining/subscribing to me on social media, leaving comments, and using the in-game shop I plan to add in the future so that I can consider game development a viable career.",
"I like the idea of making my ideas come to life in a new, fun, interesting, and engaging way, and I don't want all my effort to go to waste.",
