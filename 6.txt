EA saving face! Or perhaps just a preservation effort.
3/16/2025

Command & Conquer (Tiberian Dawn), Red Alert, Renegade, and Generals have all had their source code released.

This is likely due to the huge amount of negativity surrounding the companies practices currently, however
the claims from EA would probably deny this and claim it as an ongoing effort to preserve the franchise.  

Whatever the case any developer can now tinker with very real original C&C source code.

The source code for Command & Conquer and Red Alert was previously released in 2020 as part of the Command & Conquer Remastered Collection, but this new release includes the "fully recovered source code".
