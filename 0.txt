IndieGameNews
â €
IndieGameNews is a website I came up with when I saw how badly there was a need for game journalists in a time where 
there was very little respect for the "dying" field of gaming journalism. Here on this website you'll be able to read 
about games, mechanics, concepts, and interviews of things which are new, old, and haven't even come out yet. 

Enjoy :)
