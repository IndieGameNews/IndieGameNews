Lindwyrm by GhostWhale Games, worth playing?
IndieGameNews 1/7/25

Lindwyrm, developed by Ghostwhale Games, is a roguelite action RPG that combines hack-and-slash combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. Set in the village of Sigiswal, players explore dungeons inspired by European folklore, battling creatures and aiding in the village's reconstruction.

As of January 2025, Lindwyrm holds a "Positive" rating on Steam, with 86% of 15 user reviews expressing approval. Players commend its engaging gameplay loop, cooperative multiplayer for up to four players, and the unique integration of European mythological elements. The variety of weapons and the rune system, which allows for skill customization, are also highlighted as strengths. But I must hold a disclaimer that Lindwyrm has obtained very few reviews, numbering no more than 15 which seems very low for a game in early access in January 2025

However, some users note the game's early access status, mentioning occasional bugs and areas where visuals and gameplay could be enhanced, with sluggish gameplay and slowdowns. However this journalist thinks these are minor problems which will likely be patched in the final release.

Lindwyrm offers a promising blend of action, exploration, and folklore-inspired storytelling. While still in early-access, it has garnered positive feedback, a notable feature is its death setting.

"Embark on a dangerous journey where every defeat has its price. Do you hate losing? Then choose your path carefully, because death will take your hard-earned loot! And as if that wasn't enough, the rune curse increases with every fatal exit, which can cost your hero valuable bonuses."

which would seem to indicate that players are punished severely for dying in the game.
